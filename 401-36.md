## Cognito

### Cognito Overview

* **Cognito** is Amazon's proprietary framework for authentication and authorization. Cognito allows for user login via an app-specific user credential or existing Amazon or third-party accounts (Such as Google or Facebook), with app users collected in  repositories called **User Pools**. Authenticated users then use the credentialing provided by Cognito to access AWS-serviced app features or content (depending on authorization level).

The following diagram [from AWS's Cognito docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html) illustrates the request sequence for users through an integrated app:

### Cognito & Amplify Integration

* Cognito has many defaul settings and UI elements available, and allows for configuration of username and password requirements, account confirmation via email address or multi-factor authentication.

* On Android, Cognito requires the integrating app be bult around Android API 16 or later and use Amplify libraries. ([Commands for configuring an existing project for Cognito features are available here](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/android/#goal)).
