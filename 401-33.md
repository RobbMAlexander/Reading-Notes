## GraphQL

### GraphQL Overview

* GraphQL is a data querying language for databases or similar API usage.

* Data is distinguished by [type](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/), with fields and methods for each.

* GraphQL handles requests in parsed JSON format.

### @connection

* Among the [schema annotations](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli-legacy/graphql-transformer/directives/), `directive` followed by `@connection` allows establishing relationships between resources (1-to-1; 1-to-many; many-to-many). An example (from the [Amplify docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli-legacy/graphql-transformer/connection/#connection)) is:

```java
directive @connection(keyName: String, fields: [String!]) on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

* The values for `fields` and `keyName` establish associated resources and defined indexes for the relationship.
