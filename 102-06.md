# 102-06: JavaScript

## About JavaScript
* Programming language often seen in web development (among other uses)
* Compiles during execution ("Just-in-Time" computation)
* Can treat functions as variables ("First-Class Functions") for use by other functions or operations
* Trademarked by Oracle

## Input & Outputs
* Can be programmed for client-side inputs to affect the rendered output

## Variables
* Use `var` to define variables and store values, like: 
`var a = 12;`
* Variable definitions may refer to other variables, like: 
'var grandtotal = subtotal1 + subtotal2;
var subtotal1 = a + b + c;
var subtotal2 = x + y + z;`

### Identifiers 
* Used to store variables
* Naming restrictions: Letters & limited characters (underscore & dollar sign); case-sensitive; some command words excluded

### Assignment Operator
* `=`
* *Not* an "equals" operation (this is `==` in JavaScript)
* Can be used to adjust value of stored variable by referring to existing value, like: `var x = x +1;` to add 1 to the value of the "x" variable

### Stored Values
* Numerals
* Text strings (; must be in quotes), like `var shave_and_a_haircut = "Two Bits";`
* (Not exhaustive list of possible value types)
* Variables may exist without defined value by being declared first, like `var Whatsit` and can be assigned a value separately from declaration
* Multiple variables may be declared in one line(or several), separated by commas and each after respective assignment operators, like :`var favfood = "Pizza", favcolor = "Purple";
* Re-declaration (alone) does not affect stored value
* A numeral in quotes is treated as a text string, as are subsequent numerals in declaration, and will have a value of concatenated digits rather than arithmetic

### Variable Interactions
* Arithmetic interactions
* Multiple text strings displayed in order, like `var sandwich = "PB" + "J"` which outputs `sandwich` as `"PBJ"`
