## OAuth

### OAuth 2.0 In Spring Boot

* On top of the Spring Security tools, Spring Boot natively supports OAuth 2.0 for integrated authorization via Google or GitHub.
  * This process includes registering the app (for example, with Github) and providing a callback URL (for a local project, this may look like "http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github"). In addition to importing Spring Security dependencies in the appropriate file, the "application.yml" file needs to include the following block with credentials inserted(replacing the github values with those provided by GitHub):
  
  ```java
  spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          github:
            clientId: github-client-id
            clientSecret: github-client-secret
  ```

### Functionality

* This process grants an *access token* to the application, and a corresponding cooke named `JSESSIONID` will be stored by the browser.

* Rendering conditionally based on authentication state may be done either client-side or server-side. HTML elements with the class `container authenticated` will only render when a user has a valid authentication token (while `container unauthenticated` is used to exclude elements in this case)
