## Room

### Room Overview

* Room is a library used for local caching that makes use of annotations for commonly used persistence code. 

* Room functionality is composed of: 

  * `AppDatabase` class extending `RoomDatabase`(and `@Database` annotation, which much have an array assigned to `entities`).

  * **DAOs** (data access objects) for providing methods that interact with the database.

  * **Data entities** for each of the database's tables.

### Entities

* Classes with the `@Entity` annotation will by default have database columns corresponding to their fields.

* `@PrimaryKey` is used to annotate the field used for unique identification within that table. (can set `autoGenerate` property for ID values). A pair/set of columns may be used instead, assigned to `primaryKeys` within the `@Entity` parenthetical code.

### Data Relationships

* To relate two Room entities, either:
  * Write an annotated `@Query` method to return a mapped set of objects. This approach requires more and more complicated SQL queries.

  * Write a class for data access with the `@Dao` annotation which gets relevant data from the DB.
