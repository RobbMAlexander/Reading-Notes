## Spring

### Spring Overview

* **Spring** is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework

* MVC: a design pattern where software is divided into three distinct categories:

  * Model - Class/data structure-- much can be easily reused between applications

  * View - Frontend rendered content and UIs

  * Controller - Backend data flow management of both Model and View layers

* A subset of data that is accessible during viewing is *model attributes*. The `addAttribute()` method, `ModelAndView()` function, and `@ModelAttribute` annotation before a function all define model attributes.

* Model attributes can be accessed with the `${attributeName}` syntax.

* Attributes can be defined for a particular session or request
