## Arrays, Loops, & Imports

### Loops

#### Types of Loops in Java

* `for` : (as in JS): iterates based on set (int) variable that is adjusted through each loop.
  * Example using all three (individually optional) elements: `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)`
  * Can be broken with `break` (named loop may be specified)

  * Can be named using the following syntax, where "nameHere" is the desired name: `nameHere: for (`

  * Can iterate over a collection/array. Example iterating over "elementHere" in "arrayHere" `for(Type elementHere : arrayHere)`

* `for each`: compact form of iteration, like `exampleArr.forEach(exampleElement -> System.out.println(exampleElement));`

* `while` : Defines a condition, then repeats code block until condition is not true or loop is explicitly broken (`break`). Uses syntax `while (conditionHere) {codeBlockHere}`

* `do-while` : Subset of "while" loop that iterates once before checking condition. Syntax:
`do {`
`codeToDo;`
`} while (condition);`

### Importing packages

* Recall: Package names in Java are the directory name

* When declared, package must be declared *first*, followed by imports

* packages may end in wildcard `*` to include all classes of that package instead of particular classes
  * classes may be fully named (by directory/package) within code instead of imported

* Importing all classes is not significant to performance, and is less error-prone due to potential naming issues caused by explicit class imports
