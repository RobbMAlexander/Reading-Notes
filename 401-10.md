## Stacks & Queues

### Stacks

* Stacks are Node-based data structures with some similarities to and some distinctions from linked lists. Nodes have references to the subsequent node.

* Stack vocabulary:

  * *Push* into the stack

  * *Pop* out of a stack

  * *Top* of the stack is the most recently pushed node (and first to be popped out)

  * *Peek* at the top of the stack

* Stack principles:

  * First-in, last-out (and vice-versa)

  * Bottom node references "null"

### Queues

* Queues are another "directional" data structure.

* Common queue vocabulary:

  * *Enque* nodes to add to the queue

  * *Dequeue* nodes to remove from queue

  * *Front* first Node

  * *Rear* last Node

  * *Peek* at the front Node's held value

* Queue principles:

  * First-in, first-out

  * Last-in, Last-out
