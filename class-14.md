## Class 14 Readings

### Working in Teams

* Savvy employers recognize that employees are not isolated units to be optimized in a vacuum

* Team dynamics are *not* the same as 1-on-1 dynamics

* The proven value of collaboration means that attempts are continually made to increase the effectiveness of teams *as* teams

* Research into effective teamwork is *quite* recent

* 2008 Carnegie Mellon, MIT, & Union College experiment: findings framed group performance in terms of "collective intelligence"; was highly dependant on members' treatment of one another (more predictive than individual intelligence of members or than group structure), desribed as **psychological safety** of group members

### CSS Transforms, Transitions, & Animation

#### Transforms

* Transform property supported by CSS3

* Allows for distortion and rotation of elements along axes (including 3-dimensionally)

* Properties include: rotation (`rotate`); scaling size (`scale`); repositioning (`translate`); distortion along axes (`skew`). Can be used in combination

* Can be used to achieve appearance of three-dimensionality.

#### Transitions

* Set multiple states for an element to change between

* `transition-` properties set define and limit the transition ranges, periods, or values

#### Animations

* Using similar principles to transitions, can set multiple highly controlled transitions in CSS

* Can set frame count & duration; set animation based on existing elements using logic similar to transitions and transforms (relocate, distort, etc.)
