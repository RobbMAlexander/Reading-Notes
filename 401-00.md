## The Command Line ([Cheat Sheet](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheet.php))

* Command Line/Terminal Basics:
  * **Prompts**: indicate that terminal is ready to receive commands/input. May not appear if command is currently processing or under other conditions

  * **Shells**: (like Bash -- "Bourne-Again Shell") operating system elements that determine terminal appearance and behavior.

* Command Examples (Review):
  * `pwd`: Print Working Directory. Outputs current directory that terminal is operating in.

  * `ls` : List. Outputs files in working directory. Options include `-l` (Long) or `-a` (All) for more or otherwise hidden information.

  * `cd`: Change Directory. "Moves" to other directories, eithrer via relative or absolute paths.

  * `file`: Checks file type of argument (important, as Linux *does not* use Windows-style extension suffixes)

  * `mkdir`: Make Directory. Creates a "folder" with the name/path given as argument. Options include: `-p` for creation of parent directories "on the way", `-v` to output created directory (no output by default)

  * `rmdir`: Remove Directory. (same options as `mkdir`)

  * `touch`: Modify file given as argument -- notably creates file if it does not exist.

  * `man`: Manual Pages. Displays information on a command entered as argument. (searchable with `-k`)

* Paths:
  * Relative: Only refer to working directory for naming structure.

  * Absolute: Begin with `/`, denoting root directory.

  * Shortcuts & symbols:
    * `~`: Home directory.

    * `.`: Working directory.

    * `..`: Parent of working directory (can be repeated)

    * `Tab` key: Auto-completes based on recent commands, local files, or expected keywords.

* Keep in mind...

  * Linux is extensionless (no file type suffixes)

  * Linux is case-sensitive

  * Spaces in names are valid, but must be single-quoted around full file name or escaped w/ `\`

## Review: Growth Mindset

### Basics of Growth Midset

* Abilities are developed over time (preferably with conscious effort)

* Growth is aided by a realistic sense of progress (rather than "good" vs "bad" skillset)

* **"Deliberate Practice"** ([As defined here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice))

  * Repeatable

  * Challenging

  * Clear measures of success/progress

### Emotional Intelligence

* Keep in mind:

  * Awareness of one's own emotional context can help to regulate stressful situations, and can help in better understanding and communicating with others.

  * (I have benefited from the crisis intervention training I've received, much of which is based in effectively empathizing)

### Bias

* Addressing bias effectively requires conscious reflection, not the simple absence of animosity.

* (In assessments, I consistently rate well in valuing an understanding of bias and in addressing my own, but not as well in "courage" or "outspokenness")
