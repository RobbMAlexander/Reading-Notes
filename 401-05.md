## Linked Lists and Efficiency

### Big O

* "Big O" (Order) of a function is the magnitude of its efficiency (based on the worst efficiency possible as written), consisting of two parts:

  * Time Complexity: the time taken for the function to run.

  * Space Complexity: the memory required for a function to run.

* Input Size: Represented by `n`, accounts for the parameters that are taken in by the function.

* Units of Measurement for Efficiency:

  * Time: Milliseconds elapsed during function; operation count during a function; and the most significant or "basic operation" executed within the function.

  * Memory usage: Algorithm code storage; input data storage; output data storage; and **working space** required for execution.

* Orders of growth: magnitude of efficiency based on size of input `n`.
  * Constant: Represented by `1`, indicates that efficiency is independent of the value of inputs.

  * Logarithmic: represented by `lgn`, indicates decreasing rate in loss of efficiency as `n` increases.

  * Linear: represented by `n`, represents direct proportionality of efficiency to value of `n`

### Linked Lists

* Linked lists are **linear** data structures. Data is sequential, however *memory* is not contiguous (unlike with arrays). Because of this, the number of **nodes** may be adjusted as needed by [re]assigning their references. A `Current` variable begins at the **head** and tracks traversal per `Next` value (like with a `while` loop checking reference values).

* Anatomy of a node in a linked list:

  * **Data** held

  * **Reference** to next node in list

* Types of linked lists:

  * Singly linked: unilateral-- begins with the **head** until the last node, which references **null**

  * Doubly linked: bilateral-- contains references to **next** and to **previous** nodes (by using more memory).

  * Circular: *mostly* unilateral, but all nodes reference one and are referenced by one in continuous loop with the exception of the **tail**, which refers to another node already referenced rather than to a **null** value.

* Disadvantages:
  * slow traversal (O(n))

  * no `for` or `for-each` loops
