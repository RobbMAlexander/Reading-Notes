  * In-app purchases: Additional paid content is available within the already accessed app (whether initially paid or free)

  * Subscription models: Some or all content depends on recurring billing

  * Advertisement: Ad frameworks ([Google AdMob](https://admob.google.com/home/admob-advantage/?_ga=2.222508955.1653378354.1648709168-1745488487.1648709168)) allow for highly automated ad connectivity, filtering, and payment.
