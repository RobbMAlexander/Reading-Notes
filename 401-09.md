## Java's Web Request Response Cycle

### WRRC Overview

1. Local processing
2. DNS Request (for IP address)
3. TCP Connection (to ensure packet order)
4. HTTP Request (request line, header, & body)
5. Finish & Acknowledgement packets (both directions)

### Java's WRRC

* Java uses the `HttpClient` class and contained methods for web requests and responses (formerly used `HttpUrlConnection` class)
  
* HttpUrlConnection
  
  * Pros: No library imports required; 

  * Cons: Limited functionality compared to other libraries; Many deprecated features; 

  * Common request-related methods: `openConnection()` to create instance (of object, not connection itself); `.setRequestMethod()` with the argument being the desired request (`GET`, `DELETE`, `TRACE`, etc); `getHeaderField()` for reading headers from the calling connection; `setConnectTimeout()` (in milliseconds); `HttpCookie.parse()`

* HttpClient

  * Pros: multiple threads in req/res; easier to maintain;  optional asynchronicity;

  * Common request-related methods: `.header()`/`.headers()` (depending on if using one pair per or multiple pairs of key-values); `timeout()` (with #, then units as args); `.newBuilder()` to create a new builder instance which has many related methods;
