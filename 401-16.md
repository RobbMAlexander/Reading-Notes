## Spring Authentication

([Cheat Sheet by Michelle Ferreirae](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-java-401d2/blob/master/SpringAuthCheatSheet.md))

### Ahuthentication

* **Authentication** (or "access control") is a process to verify the identity of a particular user.

  * In Spring, the primary imported code blocks used are `AuthenticationManager`:

```java
public interface AuthenticationManager {

  Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication)
    throws AuthenticationException;
}
```

and an implemented `ProviderManager` and a series of `AuthenticationProvider` instances:

```java
public interface AuthenticationProvider {

	Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication)
		throws AuthenticationException;

	boolean supports(Class<?> authentication);
}
```

`ProviderManager`s can have children which in turn have their own respective `AuthenticationProvider`s.

* The `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` class is used for quickly setting up authentication features, and uses the `@Autowired` annotation to build `AuthenticationManager`s.

### Authorization

* As opposed to authentication, **Authorization** is the degree of access or modification privilages a given user has. Similarly to the Authentication hierarchy, an `AccessDecisionManager` may handle multiple instances of `AccessDecisionVoter`

### Servlet Filters

* Client requests to the application go through multiple filters first (determined by container) before the appropriate servlet. `Filter`s are `@Bean`s that have systems of prioritizing their order (by the `DEFAULT_ORDER` property).
  * As the filters within Spring's auth system are not accessible to the container, added filters must be `FilterRegistrationBeans` or else not be made `@Bean`s.

* Spring Security functions as a single filter in this sequence (as `FilterChainProxy`) but has several layers of sub-filters in alternate alternate chains internally.
  * By default, there are 11 filters in the `FilterChainProxy` to cover common routes (like `/error` or `/images/**`) as well as a wildcard route (`/**`) for other cases.

### Request Matching

* Filter chains have **request matchers** that determine which set of filters will apply (at the exclusion of others). Within a chain, `HttpSecurity` further controls authorization.

### Method Access

* Spring Security can also further control resource access within a code base (`@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnables = true)`) by annotating particular methods. The following example is from [the Spring guide on authorization](https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-security-architecture/):

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

  @Secured("ROLE_USER")
  public String secure() {
    return "Hello Security";
  }

}
```
