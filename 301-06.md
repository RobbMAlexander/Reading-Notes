## React - NODE.JS

* **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime (program that executes JS code).

* Node.js runs in the **V8 engine,** which compiles JS code. V8 is used in Chrome and Chromium-based browsers (I'm running v16.13.0).

* **npm** is the initialism for **Node package manager**, and is a program that coordinates installation of a *wide* variety of JS code bases from a terminal (I'm running version 8.1.0). commands are structured as `npm` [command name] [dashed flag] [file/program name], like:
`npm install -g jshint`
for the global installation of "jshint."

* Uses for Node.js include:
  
  * Running JS on a server

  * Managing download and installation of packages

### Pair Programming

* Pair programming is a method of programming that uses two developers to coordinate work in rotated roles. Advantages include: 

  * Quality of the end-product tends to be higher (even considering time taken) given the live review of code.

  * Engagement in the work is greater, and the sense of accountability to a colleage can focus work.

  * Education on techniques as well as exposure to another dev's perspective in problem solving.

  * An exercise in communication and social engagement. Directly working with another dev can help their communication later on separate tasks.

  * An expectation in some job interviews-- establishes a prospective employee's communication an collaboration abilities.

## Things I want to know more about

* How frequent is pair programming in workplaces? Is it dependent on the task?
