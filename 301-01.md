## Intro to React -- Components

  * **Components**: Distinct units of function and design within a larger project. By working in a system of compenents, features can be developed in reusable, easily targetable ways to focus development. In the case of React, components can be moved, replaced, reused, and extended with less strain on the overall code base.

  * **"Props"**: a reserved React keyword, abbreviating "properties." Props are key-value pair data inherited by a component from another component *and unchanged by the child component*. This one-way data flow can allow for locally constant data that a given component can handle dynamically without impacting other components that may inherit it as well.

## Things I want to know more about

* Real-world uses for props -- are enormous "prop libraries" within React projects common?
