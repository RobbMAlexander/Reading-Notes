# Unit 8: Operators & Loops

## Loops & Iteration in Javascript

# Loops
* Repeated actions with beginning and ending points determined by statements:
   * *for*
   * *do...while*
   * *while*
   * *labeled*
   * *break*
   * *continue*
   * *for...in*
   * *for...of*

## `for` Statements
* Loop until condition evaluates as `false`. 
* Anatomy: `for`, followed by two/three paranthetical expressions separated by semicolons, then a statement. Like:
* `for (let a = 200; a > previousvariablehere; a = a / 2) 
* let cutstatus = 'halved' `
* The *initial expression*: first paranthetical. This executes, and can declare variables
* The *condition expression*: second paranthetical. This is evaluated, and if true loop executes. If false, `for` terminates (note:w/out condition statement, executes as if true)
* The *statement*: executes. Can group multiple in the same curled brackets
* The *increment expression*: executes if present
* Loop returns to *condition* expression

## `while` Statements
* Executes as long as condition evaluates true
* Anatomy: `while`, followed by paranthetical condition, then statement. Like:
`while (condition) 
statement'
* The *condition* is tested before execution. If true, *statement* executes and *condition* is tested again. If false, loop terminates and passes to *statement*
* Multiple statements can be blocked together in curly brackets
* Note: make sure condition eventually returns `false` -- otherwise loop is infinite
