# 102-02 Reading Notes: Text Editors & Terminals

## Text Editors in Comparison

### Things to look for in a text editor:
#### Readibility 
* Syntax highlighting
* Reduced eye strain
* Comfortable layout
#### Coding-friendly features
- Auto-complete
- Bracket, quote closing
#### Extensions
- Features & functionality beyond basic text
- Adaptability for future changes/needs
#### Plain text?
- Typeface changes are a red flag
- Keep saved file extension suffix in mind
- No coding assistance
#### Vs. Integrated Development Environment
- IDEs include features like compiling & debugging

## Terminal Use Tips & Terminology

Command line = Terminal

-Prompt-> command -> command line arguments

* "Commands" are followed *by spaces* and then by command line arguments
* Not all commands produce output when successful
* Shell: OS feature managing terminal behavior & appearance
* "Up Arrow" & "Down Arrow" keys retrieve previous command entries

### Locations, Navigation, & Directories

#### Important Commands

- 'PWD'  (Print Working Directory) : outputs current working location

- 'ls' (List) : outputs files & directories at location; can be refined with command line options & arguments

- 'cd' (Change Directory) : used with command line arguments to change to specified directory (returns home if blank)

- [in Linux] 'file' : Outputs file type at specified path

#### Paths
- Files & directories identified within tiered structure
- 
- Root directory is `/`, followed by subdirectories
- 
- **Relative** (no specified directory; no initial `/`) or **Absolute** paths may describe the same file
- `~` : Home directory stand-in in paths
- `.` : Current directory stand-in in paths
- `..` : Parent (root-ward) directory stand-in in paths; can be repeated (ie., "../../Document1.txt)"
- [In Linux] Can be hidden with `.` preceding file name, ie. " .Document1.txt" ; "-a" command line argument for 'ls' command includes hidden files

#### Tips
- Hit 'Tab' key for auto-complete (hit again if multiple possibilities); *automatically* escapes spaces in paths
- [In Linux] Case sensitivity in paths (including extension suffixes) and commands
- Be wary of spaces in path names (use quotes around path in terminal, ie. " 'My Documents ' " or '\' before space, ie. "My\ Documents")
