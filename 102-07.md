# 102-07: Programming With JavaScript

## Operators
* **Unary**: Single operand (before or after)
* **Binary**: Two operands, one before and one after operator
* **Ternary**: Conditionals

### Assignment Operators
* Assign first (*left*) operand a value determined by the second (*right*) operand
* `=` is the simplest assignment operator, assigning the second operand value to the first operand
* Compound assignment operators abbreviate operations (Listed [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators))
* Can be used to evaluate a variable and assign a new value, like:
* `a = f();` , which would assign the value/result of `f()` to variable `a` ; or:
* `let b = z();` which results in an initial assignment for `b` of the value of `z()`
* Can be chained/nested--*to be used with caution*-- to be used in function calls assingment of other variables, and more (right-associative, evaluated left-to-right)

### Comparison Operators
* Return a logic value depending on the comparison ("true")
* Converts some values to equivalent type if possible
* `===` and `!==` (*equality* and *inequality* operators) do not convert
* (Listed [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators))

### Arithmetic Operators
* Return a single numerical value
* Standard arithmetics (`+``-``*``/`) as well as others listed [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#arithmetic_operators)
* Can be used with strings (like for *concatenation* of text with `+`)

### Logical Operators
* `&&` - logical "and"
* `||` - logical "or" 
* `!` - logical "not"

## Functions
* Take input and return related output
* Must be defined from where it is called
* Anatomy: Name, parenthetical parameters (with commas between), JavaScript definition (in curled brackets)
* Names can contain letters, digits, `_`, and `$`
* The values received by the function when invoked are called **arguments**, which are locally variables within the function
* **Declared** with the `function` keyword, setting the following text as the declared function's name, like:`function TriAdd(firsts, seconds, thirds) {
return firsts+seconds+thirds;
}`
* User-defined objects that are parameters can be changed outside the scope of that function
* The definition of a function does not execute it
* *Calling* the function executes it

## Control Flow
* **Control Flow**: Order of execution of script statements
* Executes from top line to bottom *except* for conditional or looping structures
