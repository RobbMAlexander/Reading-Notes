* **Unary**: Single operand (before or after)
* **Binary**: Two operands, one before and one after operator
* **Ternary**: Conditionals

### Assignment Operators
* Assign first (*left*) operand a value determined by the second (*right*) operand
* `=` is the simplest assignment operator, assigning the second operand value to the first operand
* Compound assignment operators abbreviate operations (Listed [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators))
* Can be used to evaluate a variable and assign a new value, like:
* `a = f();` , which would assign the value/result of `f()` to variable `a` ; or:
* `let b = z();` which results in an initial assignment for `b` of the value of `z()`
* Can be chained/nested--*to be used with caution*-- to be used in function calls assingment of other variables, and more (right-associative, evaluated left-to-right)

### Comparison Operators
* Return a logic value
