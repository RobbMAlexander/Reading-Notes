## Inheritance & Interfaces

### Inheritance

* In Java, **subclasses** of a class ("**superclass**" relative to the subclass) inherit state and behavior, such as having access to all methods defined for the parent class.

* Each class may have only one superclass "above" it in inheritance, but has no limit to the number of subclasses "below".

* Subclass delcaration syntax: `class SubclassName extends SuperclassName {/*subclass code block*/}`

### Interfaces

* In Java, an interface is a specified list of object behaviors. 

* Interface syntax:
`interface ClassName {`
`void methodToImplementLater(int parameterName);`
`}`

* An **implemented** class must define each method declared in the interface.

* Implementation syntax:
`class ImplementedClassName implements ClassName`
`{`
`/*code block*/`
`void methodToImplementLater (int parameterName) {`
`/*method code block*/`
`}`

### Packages

* A Java **package** is a grouping of related or otherwise interacting classes and interfaces.

* The **Application Programming Interface** package for Java contains very many commonly used classes ([Documentation Here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html))
