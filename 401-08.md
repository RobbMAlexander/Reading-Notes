## Object-Oriented Design Principles

### "DRY"

* **"Don't Repeat Yourself":** A development philosophy where repeated code is avoided.

* Described by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."

* Advantages include:

  * Easier refactoring, as key code does not affect unrelated code.

  * More uniformity, as code blocks refer to required logic rather than partially recreating.

### Rule of Three

* **Rule of Three** refers to the guideline of waiting for the third use of a potentially abstracted code element before abstracting.

* Immediate abstraction is avoided, as core requirements and definitions may not be feasibly recognized with few instances.

### YAGNI

* **"You Aren't Gonna Need It"**: Design principle that discourages adding more functionality than currently required.

* Defined as part of **extreme programming** philosophy alongside frequent testing and refactoring practices.

### MVP

* **Minimum Viable Product:** The simplest build of a product that allows use.

* Advantages include:
  * Testing and feedback from early use, leading to user-informed development earlier in the cycle.

  * Shorter time to abandonment of unviable products.

  * More recognition of product and/or brand
