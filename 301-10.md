## JavaScript Call Stack

* **Calls**: a "call" is the invocation of a JavaScript object (such as a function); Calls are "stacked" in order, executing one at a time in a "Last in, first out" ("LIFO") schedule.
For example, if functions "C", "B", and "A" were visualized nested like: [C[B[A]]], they would execute from "inner" to "outer" in "A" "B" "C" order.

* a **stack overflow** is a recursive invocation loop that exceeds the maximum allowed by the hosting environment.

## JavaScript Error Messages

* **Reference Errors**: Caused by invoking undeclared variables.

* **Syntax Errors**: caused by symbol misplacement that makes code unworkable. (Note-- some hosting environments have degrees of self-correcting syntax.)

* **Range Errors**: Caused by setting invalid values, like negative array lengths.

* **Type Errors**: Caused by attempting operations on inappropriate types of data for for that operation.

* **Breakpoints**: Lines of code that the execution will stop at, allowing a more focused look at potential sources of error (and fewer invocations in the stack). Breakpoints can be marked with `debugger` in the line of code desired.

## Things I want to know more about

* How different is error handling in other programming languages? Also, does the stack fundamentally differ?
