## Analytics - AdMob

### Overview

* **Google AdMob** is a monetization service that simplifies integration of advertisements into mobile apps using Google's Mobile Ads SDK. The app itself must be registered with a unique ID, and AdMob libraries must be imported as well as added to the app's manifest ([As seen here](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start)). Ads can be connected to conditional user content or data manipulation (for instance, access to certain rendered images/videos or currencies/actions similar to IAP). The locations, types, and pools of ads may be configured and customized.
