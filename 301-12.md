## CRUD

### Status codes

* 100-range: Informational codes confiriming receipt of request.

* 200-range: Indicate an accepted request, like `204`, which represents a confirmation of updates that do not themselves return to the clien. *However,* some codes don't necessarily indicate complete processing (like `202`, which indicates asynchronous processing that was initially validated; `201`, which indicates a successful creation of an object, and `200`, which indicates a generic "successful request" status)

* 300-range: Indicate redirection to another resource (like `308`, which indicates the permanent redirection to another resource--- useful if hosting or server routes have changed)

* 400-range: *Client* error codes. These represent bad requests on client end (like `410`, which indicates that the resource was formerly located at that route but currently has no associated redirect, or `403`, which indicates lack of client permissions for the resource)

* 500-range: *Server* error codes (indicate unreachable or overtaxed server, or unhandled exceptions)

### REST API

* When setting up a MongoDB database in a Node.JS environment, it is important to remove the database connection string from the server itself and store it in a separate .env file so that the `process.env` placeholder in code allows for functioning in both the local and deployed settings.
**Middleware** programs and libraries facilitate easier establishment and coding of a server and the related files

*`app.use(express.json())` allows the server to properly parse files in the `.json` format (common for data sets)

* Adding `'/:id'` to a route adds parameters that can be passed into the URL.

* When updating limited fields of data with a request, `PATCH` should be used (as opposed to `PUT` for replacement of all fileds within the relevant set of data)

* The constructor function can be used to establish the default data schema: when defining the data type for different properties, ("properties of properties") set a key of `default` with the required default value.

## Things I want to know more about

Apparently the **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority** maintains the standardized HTTP Status Code Registry, but what is the process for new accepted values? Do shifts in the sorts of data use and traffic lead to lobbying for new consistent code messaging for some statuses or issues?
