## Passing Functions as Props

### React: Lists and Keys ([Described Here](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html))

* In React syntax, `{}` can be placed around an array to use it as a list of elements.

* `.map()` may be used to programmatically return React elements out of a JS array argument.

* Items in a list require unique respective keys (index values may be used if other unique data is not available, but this use has limitations). Keys only have to be *locally* unique (among sibling components).

* Keys are used to identify specific elements during React events like addition, editing, or removal.

### Spread Operator

* In JS, the **Spread Operator** `...` has multiple uses to affect objects (especially arrays). The spread operator:

  * ...can precede an array to allow surrounding code to operate as if the array were a separate list of JS objects (like multiple arguments in a function). This can then be used to copy or combine arrays, like:
  `const nums = [1, 2, 3]`
  `const moreNums = [...nums, 4, 5]`
  to create an array of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

  * ...can can be used with multiple `Math.` functions which require multiple arguments in order to pass in a single array.

  * ...can be used to add to a React state (not otherwise possible with many traditional JS methods) by combining arrays.

  * ...can combine object properties/methods into a new object (similar syntactic use as for arrays), like:
  `familyDog = {bark: true}`
  `familyCat = {meow: true}`
  `familyPets = {...familyDog, ...familyCat}`

### Passing Functions Between Components ([Seen Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c05OL7XbwXU))

* In order to pass a function between React components, first create a variable inside that function that will be assigned an object "copy" of a parent component's object (thus making it editable at the child component level). The function can then be set as a method among the child component's properties, thus giving child components access to a function that exists in other components.

## Things I want to know more about

* React dataflow and events: when to avoid re-rendering / selective re-rendering;
