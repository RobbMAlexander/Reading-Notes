## React Lifecycle ([Outlined Here](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093))

* Split into several phases:

  * Mounting: Insertion into DOM. Events happen in order:

    * `constructor` - calls component before mounting; assigns state

    * `getDerivedStateFromProps` - 

    * `render` - *required* method for class components. Does not modify state.

    * `componentDidMount` - called after mounting; used for network dependencies, DOM initialization

  * Updating: Rerendering due to state changes or component updates. Events happen in order: 

  * `getDerivedStateFromProps`

  * `shouldComponentUpdate` - can be set to false to prevent re-renders on state change.

  * `render` - (see above)

  * `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` - 

  * `componentDidUpdate` -  similar to `componentDidMount`, used for network involvement or other dependencies.

  * `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate`

  * `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps`

  * Unmounting: Component removal. Only event is `componentWillUnmount`

## React State Vs Props ([Explained Well Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI))

### Props

* Passed into a component from outside

* Unchanged by component itself

### State

* Updated *within* component

* Trigger re-rendering (by default) on changes in state

* Can store changable version of data (examples-- user data, counters, dynamic displays)

## Things I want to know more about

* performance, longevity, and security advantages/drawbacks of React components & related methods compared to vanilla JS & HTML DOM manipulation
