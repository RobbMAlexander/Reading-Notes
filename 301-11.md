## SQL and NoSQL

| SQL     | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| RDBMS    | Non-relational/distributed database |
| Table-based   | Document-based (various schema)      |
| Vertically scalable     | Horizontally scalable |
| Complex queries | Weaker queries |
|  Wide availability of support    | Limited support sources    |

* **SQL**: (often pronounced like "Sequel") Structured Query Language-- A language that is used to write queries for management of data in a database (modification, deletion, insertion, retrieval). SQL is based around a table structure for all data.

  * Database schema-- the defined fields within data that all data within the DB must conform to.
  
  * SQL is *relational*- it uses multiple tables of data that may be distinguished by schema but can be compared, connected, and cross-referenced. (example:*one-to-one* or *one-to-many* relation of one data point to fields in other tables)

  * SQL is appropriate for normalized, distributed data.

    * Real World Robb Examples: My previous job made extensive use of databases (most in SQL-based systems, others I do not know the basis of) to manage class action lawsuit data. Depending on the case, individual claimants may have multiple claims per-vehicle, account, or purchase of a product or service. Overall each individual claimant needed consistent types of data for a name, contact information, and system ID, while each *claim* had a set of data that was particular to each case and tied to a claimant ID as well as having a separate ID category of its own.
  
  * SQL can only effectively scale **vertically**-- by adding more computing power.

* **NoSQL**: NoSQL consists of data "collections" rather than tables, and no schema is enforced on data within the same collection.

  * NoSQL is appropriate for large and potentially changable data sets within the same database.

    * Real world examples: A long-term data collection project where new parameters might be added over time for the same compared subjects.

    * NoSQL can scale **horizontally**-- by adding parallel server storage for more data in addition to **vertically**.

    * NoSQL can outperform SQL for rapid but uncomplicated read/write requests.

    * Less efficient for data sets where very few fields are consistently read or written

    * Data is stored in documents that use flexible key-value pairs similar to JSON files.

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

## Things I want to learn more about

* How do the massively decentralized computing systems of the last decade compare to SQL and NoSQL systems covered so far in how data is stored and accessed from them?
