## Espresso

### Espresso Testing Overview

* Espresso is a suite of testing-related code for Android used to reproduce UI inputs to check for expected behavior.

### Functionality

* **Espresso Test Recorder** allows for a set pattern of testing procedures done performed entirely through UI elements (rather than code) and later reproduceable.

### Things To Keep in Mind

* *Turn off animations* in the tested app before recording (may lead to "unexpected results")

* Espresso waits for certain criteria in between reproducing `onView()` invocations:
  * No ongoing `AsyncTask` executions

  * Expected *idle resources* are available
  
  * Message queue does not have pending content

* Espresso assertions come in a few primary categories for view element testing:
  * `text is` to check against expected text in an element

  * `exists` and `does not exist` to check for an element appearing in the visible layout

* Espresso supports cloud-based testing on a variety of devices using Firebase ([with some usage limitations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/get-started#quota_for_spark_and_flame_plans)).
