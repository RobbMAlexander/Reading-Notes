## Class 10 Readings

### Debugging JavaScript

#### Debugging Principles

* Consider *Order of Operations* to pinpoint problems

* Recognize/identify scope of problems (may mean some vars/functions are isolated)

#### Hoisting

* **Hoisting**: Functions may be called prior to declaration, as with variable assignments (in some cases)

#### Error Objects

* Console messages refer to specific information about errors, like specific files/lines, or error types such as syntax and type (see *Duckett on JS* p459)
