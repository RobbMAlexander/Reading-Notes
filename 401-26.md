## Android Fundamentals

### Java Apps

#### Languages

* Apps for Android devices are written in various languages:

  * Kotlin

  * C++

  * Java

#### APKs

* Android packages (`.apk`) are files which an app is installed from and include required content that is required for app execution. `.apk`s are **archive files** (1+ files along with metadata).

#### AABs

* Android App Bundles (`.aab`) are also archive files, but do not contain content required for execution. AABs are used in distribution of software that may be used by a variety of devices with particular hardware or operation differences, so the eventual APKs may differ from the some AAB.

#### App components

* Java apps are comprised of four basic components:

  * Activities: each "screen" with a respective UI. An app may have multiple, and the starting activity does not have to be a single defined one. Activities are subclasses of `Activity`.

  * Services: Subclasses of `Service` -- "background" functionality, including while another app's activity is focused. Chains of service dependencies (**Bound Services**) may exist.

  * Broadcast Receivers: Allow for resources to interact with an app outside of activities to provide it with data or trigger a service. Subclass of `BradcastReceiver` as individual `Intent` object.

  * Content Providers: Subclass of `ContentProvider`-- manages stored data using a URI convention.

### Java OS

* Android OS is Linux

* Individual apps function as respective **users** on that system

* Apps have segregated file permissions

* Each app runs as a virtual machine paralell to (and isolated from) others

#### Principle of Least Privilege

* As a general (but not unbreakable) rule, each app only has access to the minimum amount of resources required to function

* The device user must opt into additional hardware/system permissions
