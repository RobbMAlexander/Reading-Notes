## Java Basics

### Java Documentation

* Maintained by **Oracle** [Here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/index.html)

### Overview & Tips

* Compiling: The process by which some human-written coding languages (including Java) are "translated" to machine code (binary).

* Static-typing (unlike JavaScript)-- variables must have a particular data type when declared (default values will be assigned if not specified)

* Case-sensitivity

* Requires a class to nest code inside

* Syntax includes curled braces (`{}`) to separate code blocks

### Keyword Cheat Sheet

* Maintained by **dummies** [Here](https://www.dummies.com/article/technology/programming-web-design/java/java-for-dummies-cheat-sheet-207676)

* Some highlights:

  * `final`: Designates a variable/class/method as unchangable

  * `switch` : Designates a branching execution path
