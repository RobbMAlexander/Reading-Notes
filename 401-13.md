## Related Resources & Integration Testing

### One-to-One Relationships

* Using the annotation `@OneToOne` within each class (before an instance of the related class), two classes may be related.
  * Additional annotations (like `@RestResource`) may be included to further define the relationship.

* Respective repository interfaces must be made for each.

* CRUD requests may be made with respect to the related resource.

* Tested by POST-ing two objects, then PUT-ing the association. (GET the resulting resources)

### One-to-Many Relationships

* Using the two respective annotations `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` before an instance of the related class,  multiple resources may be related to a single resource.

* CRUD requests may be made with respect to the related resource to both associate an instance (PUT) and to GET the associated resources.

* Tested by POST-ing more than two objects, the PUT-ing the same relationship to the first with each other (respectively)

### Many-to-Many

* Using the annotation `@ManyToMany`, individual instances of one resource may be associated with multiple others (including webbed relationships)

### Integration Testing In Spring

* **Integration testing** is used to verify that resources have the expected relationships and interactions. ([Some documentation here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/testing.html#testing-utilities))

* The annotations `@ExtendWith()` , `@ContextConfiguration()`, and `@WebAppConfiguration` set up the testing context for the given classes to simulate relationships and associated behaviors
