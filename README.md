### Growth Mindset: Practice Makes ~~Perfect~~ Progress

Growth Mindset ([as described here](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)) is a way of seeing progress toward success as a gradient rather than discrete steps. It can be easy to get stuck viewing a learning or improvement goal as different in kind from where one begins rather than magnitude. At the outset there is the trap of defining "becoming good at" something as a transformation rather than an extension and combination of existing skills. Viewing goals like this makes the end result seem more distant at every step. Growth mindset includes a recognition that even initial intention is tangible progress. 


Reminders for my own growth-mindset mentality:
```
- Set small, short-term goals
- Recognize progress I have already made in skills and understanding
- Emphasize role of good habits in success (not just strong comprehension) 
```
