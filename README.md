### Growth Mindset: Practice Makes ~~Perfect~~ Progress

Growth Mindset[^1] is a way of seeing progress toward success as a gradient rather than discrete steps. It can be easy to get stuck viewing a learning or improvement goal as different in kind from where one begins rather than magnitude. At the outset there is the trap of defining "becoming good at" something as a transformation rather than an extension and combination of existing skills. Viewing goals like this makes the end result seem more distant at *every* step. Growth mindset includes a recognition that even initial intention is tangible progress. 


Reminders for my own growth-mindset mentality: :microscope: :hiking_boot: :repeat:
```
-Set small, short-term goals in addition to broad ones
-Recognize progress I have already made in skills and understanding
-Emphasize role of good habits in success (not just strong comprehension) 
```
