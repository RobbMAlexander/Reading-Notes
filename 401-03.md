## Maps, Primitives, & File I/O

### Primitives vs Objects

* In Java, the process of converting from a primitive (like `int`) to an object with a reference corresponding to that type (like `Integer`) is called **boxing**.

* There are memory access differences between primitives and reference types:
  * Primitives are stored on the stack and are accessed more quickly. For an `int`, 32 bits are required for storage.

  * Reference objects are stored on the heap and are accessed relatively slowly. For an `Integer,` 128 bits are required for storage.

* These memory differences are further multiplied in the case of arrays ([Example chart given in this Baeldung tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/java-primitives-vs-objects))

* When uninitialized, primitives have default values (like `0` for `int`) while wrapper objects default to `null`.

### Exceptions

* In Java, an **exception** is an event that does not fit within the defined logical flow of a program.

* Exception vocabulary:
  * A method *throws* an exception by creating an object defined for that exceptional cirucumstance.
  
  * A code block written for such an exception is called the exception *handler*.

  * A handler executing code defined for exception is said to be *catching* the exception.

### Scanning & Input/Output

* Java objects called `Scanner`s manage input from outside the program, allowing it to be handled by the program's logic.

* `Scanner`s  break input data into discrete **tokens** of a defined type (other than `char`).

* Input from a scan must be terminated with the `.close()` method when used.
