## RecyclerView

### Overview of RecyclerView

* Within an activity, `RecyclerView` is an element in a layout that binds to other elements to reuse existing views rather than removing and creating them as displayed elements change.

### Layout Types

* `LinearLayoutManager`: 1-d list

* `GridLayoutManager` : 2-d grid with standardized dimensions depending on arrangement axis

* `StaggeredLayoutManager` : 2-d offset view without standardized dimensions

### Implementation

* The key classes used with RecyclerView are `ViewHolder` and `Adapter`. Overriding several methods is necessary for proper functionality: 

  * `onCreateViewHolder()`: used for creation of views

  * `onBindViewHolder()`: used for replacing views' contents in the layout

  * `getItemCount()`: used for assessing data set sizes
