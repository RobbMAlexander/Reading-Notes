## BCrypt

* BCrypt is a codebase used for *hashing passwords* ([Site here](https://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/)) that can scale in complexity, making it more viable long-term than some solutions developed when computing power was more costly
  * Based on the **Blowfish** code developed by OpenBSD

### Password Hashing

* Password *hashing*: An alternative to **cleartext** storage of passwords as original input characters-- the hashing process algorithmically generates a new *hash* (or *digest*). ([Auth0's Tutorial Here](https://auth0.com/blog/hashing-passwords-one-way-road-to-security/))

* Hashing principles:

  * Deterministic

  * Feasible to generate (practically and computationally)

  * Difficult to reverse-engineer with only the hashed value ("small" input changes have "large" output changes)

  * Best practices change with increased availability of computing power or from known security flaws

  * Some hashing methods can lead to uniform hash length despite variable input size (SHA-256 uses *hexadecimal representation*)

* Commonly used algorithms include: SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms); MDx (Message Digest);

* *salting*: The backend addition/relation of a string to a password to increase complexity. Can be done on an individual user basis. Mitigates the deterministic vulnerability of hashes.

* **Collision Attacks** make use of the fact that multiple inputs can have the same hash, leading to potential validation of incorrect or harmful data.
