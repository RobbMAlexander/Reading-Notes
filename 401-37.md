## S3

### S3 Overview

* **Simple Storage Service** (or **S3**) is a data storage solution provided by Amazon.

  ** S3 services are divided into tiers based upon access frequency needs and pricing.

### S3 Functionality

* Data is stored as individual, uniquely-keyed objects (files and file metadata, like modification date) within a container (a **bucket**) with a user-specified name and based in a particular region. S3 supports versioning of data objects.

* **Bucket Policies**, along with **Access Control Lists** (ACLs) allow for access permissions to be defined for objects or collections of objects based on set rules (written in/around JSON).

* (Note to self-- revisit section on [S3 data consistency model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html#ConsistencyModel) for AWS's handling of requests to same buckets from multiple threads)
