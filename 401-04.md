## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Objects

* In software, objects are collections of data that include states and behaviors.
  * **States**: Changable attributes of the object. Stored in **fields** (**variables** in many languages).
  * **Behaviors**: Functions/methods that perform based on the object's state.
  * **Data encapsulation**: Principle of OOP where an object's state is only expressed/interacted with via behaviors.

* Advantages of OOP include:
  * Reusability of code

  * Portability of code to other code bases

  * Obscurity of internal data (as interactions happen on outer functional bases)

  * Can be replaced with other objects as needed

### Classes

* In programming, a class is a category of objects-- an individual object may be an instance of a given class.

* Classes are not independent applications, but are declared and called.

* Declarations include:
  * Modifiers for access

  * A capitalized name

  * A single parent class (if applicable), with syntax `extends Parent`

  * Interface(s), with syntax `implements firstInterface, subsequentInterface`

  * Code block for the body of the class within curly braces `{}`

### Number Systems

* Binary : "Base-two" numeral system. Conventionally represented with characters "0" and "1". Used in computing as most basic analogue to on/off or unpowered/powered state.

* Decimal : "Base-ten" numeral system. Characters usually used are "0", "1" through "9". Extremely common for most types of measurement in the contemporary world.

* Hexadecimal : "Base-sixteen" numeral system (contemporary characters used are : "0", "1" through "9", and "A" through "F").
  * Computing uses are common due to easier conversion from binary than to decimal notation.
