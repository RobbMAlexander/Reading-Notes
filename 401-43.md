## Open Source

### Overview

* Open-source software (OSS) is a code base that is fully visible to the public for use and addition (many projects will be somewhat moderated or managed). Use cases and motivations for contribution vary widely, and may include the pooling of developer time to solve widespread problems at a scale that individuals or smaller groups cannot, as well as the simple act of improving coding skill. Community participation and reputation are also an element of the OSS world.

### `first-timers-only`

* **First Timers Only** is a descriptive tag in use by some open-source projects in order to both encourage new contributors and to focus their efforts toward simpler or more appropriate issues for those less experienced.
