## Purely Functional Programming

### Pure vs. Impure

* Within **functional programming**, *purity* is the goal of mathematical evaluation that is independent of state. Exact definitions vary but tend to focus on the consistent evaluation of a function given the same arguments. *Impure* functional programming may use data structures or input and output which might evaluate differently given a change in data outside of the function or structure itself.

### Advantages of PFP

* As the order of evaluation will not impact the returns, evaluation of expressions can be delayed until a later reference (**lazy evaluation**).

* Lack of interaction between two functions means that the functions may be executed in parallel.

### Languagues by Purity
