# CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
Rule-based language that can change the stylistic display of a document via organization, sizing, color, and animation.

## User Agent
* Browser or other program that interprets data to render (such as organization, color, or sizing) to a viewer based on display elements beyond the source material (such as HTML)
* **User agent styles** are how a particular user agent (like one browser vs. another) interpret the same source material 

## CSS Syntax

### Selectors
* An element tag followed by braced **declarations** (instructions or characteristics, paired as **properties** and **values**)
* Example: 
`sample-element{
color:purple;
}`  
Would set all `<sample-element>` -tagged content to be colored purple
* Snytax: **property** : **value** 
* Selections can define a style set to be used whenever an attribute is given to HTML content within that document
* Selectors may operate based on element type or class, or by an attribute specified for a particular element 

### How CSS Is Read
* **External**: HTML entries refer to a separate linked style sheet ( .css file). This file has no HTML, only selectors with un-bracketed element tags.
* **Internal**: CSS style values written within the page's HTML (within <head> section, using <style> tag to bound all CSS)
* **Inline**: CSS style values written on an individual element basis, with  `style` set as an attribute with the properties & values in unspaced lists, like:
  `<p style="color:purple;text-align:right">Sample text</p>`

## Specifications
* Standardized and further developed by CSS Working Group (with an eye toward backward compatibility)

## Conflicts & Priorities
* The most recent style definition is used (allows for per-line exception to page style, or internal exception to referred external)
* Browsers have default style configurations that are used in the absence of defined styles
  
### Colors in CSS
* The value following the `color` property can be set by a name value or any of several numeric definitions (like RGB or HEX values) like:
  `<p style="color:#937EFF">Purple Text Here</p>`
