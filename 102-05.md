# CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
Rule-based language that can change the stylistic display of a document via organization, sizing, color, and animation.

## User Agent
* Browser or other program that interprets data to render (such as organization, color, or sizing) to a viewer based on display elements beyond the source material (such as HTML)
* **User agent styles** are how a particular user agent (like one browser vs. another) interpret the same source material 

## CSS Syntax

### Selectors
* An element tag followed by bracketed instructions or characteristics
* Example: 
`sample-element{
color:purple;
}`  
Would set all `<sample-element>` -tagged content to be colored purple
* Selections can define a style set to be used whenever an attribute is given to HTML content within that document
*
