## CRUD Basics ([As described Here](https://medium.com/geekculture/crud-operations-explained-2a44096e9c88))

* When communicating data to an API, HTTP methods may need to use an ID parameter depending on the type of request (required for PUT requests to update data, as well as DELETE requests)

* RESTful API creation summary:
  * Import/install desired dependencies & middleware
  * Establish routes for various document requests (CRUD)
  * Determine "shape" of data, (based on incoming sources as necessary)
  * Groom data for desired output(s)
  * Write appropriate status messages for error handling & client confirmation

## Things I want to know more about

* Which kinds of requests are used by highly decentralized applications that communicate with very many different resources despite not being traditional servers-- is it a constant stream of PUTs?
