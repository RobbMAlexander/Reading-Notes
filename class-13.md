## Class 13 Readings

### Local Storage

* Advantages over isolated web application: No need for highly limited and potentially vulnerable requests continuously; persistent

* Deprecated solutions:
  * Microsoft's**DHTML**; Flash's **Local Shared Objects**; Google's **Gears**

* HTML5: **Web Storage** feature (AKA "DOM Storage")
  * Does not rely on transmission (unlike cookies)
  * Persistent in browser
  * Based around key-value pairs
  * Accessible via JS code (examples at [this page](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html))
  * Storage capped with no in-browser capacity request feature
