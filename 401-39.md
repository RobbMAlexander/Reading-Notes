## Locations

### Google Play Location API

* The **Google Play Services** library allows for integrating device information into code. Much of this functionality requires permission requests -- like requests for access to location tracking (via GPS or Wi-Fi scans). `LocationRequest` objects allow for adjusting the frequency and precision of these requests ([parameters found here](https://developer.android.com/training/location/change-location-settings)).

* The `FusedLocationProviderClient` class allows access to device location information and related methods. The `getLastLocation()` method in particular fetches a cached location from the device (compared to `getCurrentLocation()`, which makes a new check for the device location). This method can return null in multiple cases (user settings changes can wipe the last cached location).
