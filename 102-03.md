# Version Control Systems (VCS):

* Log a history of changes to files for comparison/correction
* **Local Version Control**: Database of changes locally saved (on hard drive)
* **Centralized Version Control (CVCS)**: Single server-side database accessible by multiple clients
* **Distributed Version Control (DVCS)**: Use muitiple repositories to limit reliance on single database source (Git is one of these)

## DVCS Features of Git

* Use of snapshot comparison to determine if local files may be used
* File validity check on each change (limits corruption & loss)
* Cloning of existing repository

## Git file states: 
* **Committed**: In local database
* **Modified**: Changes not committed
* **Staged**: Will be committed w/ next snapshot

## Useful Git commands
* `$ git status` : outputs file state
* `$ git add filename` or `git add *` track & stage files for commitment ( `*` adds all repo files)
* `$ git commit -m "example commit comment"` : Commits staged files w/ message
* `$ git push origin master` : Pushes to remote repo "origin" (git default) from local repo "master" (default)
* `git stash` : temporarily sidelines changes, to be applied with `git stash apply`
* `git remote` : outputs remote handle names (use `git remote -v` to output URLs as well)
